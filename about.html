    <h2>1. History and Mission</h2>
    
FreeCodeCamp was founded in 2014 by Quincy Larson, a software engineer and educator. Larson started the project with the vision of creating a free, accessible platform where anyone with an internet connection could learn to code, regardless of their financial situation. The idea was to offer a comprehensive coding education that could be accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world.

The mission of FreeCodeCamp is to:

Provide free, high-quality coding education to anyone, regardless of background or financial status.
Help learners build skills that are directly relevant to modern web development and software engineering careers.
Create a global community of developers who can collaborate and support each other in their learning journeys.

        Learning Methodology
FreeCodeCamp uses a learn-by-doing approach, meaning that students are encouraged to complete interactive coding challenges and build projects rather than simply read through lessons or watch videos. This hands-on method is designed to simulate real-world coding scenarios, where developers must apply their knowledge to solve problems.

Key features of FreeCodeCamp’s learning methodology include:

Coding Challenges: Each lesson is followed by coding exercises that reinforce the material and help learners practice what they've learned.
Interactive Feedback: As learners complete challenges, they receive immediate feedback, which helps them identify mistakes and improve.
Projects: Learners must build projects as part of their certification process, ensuring that they can apply their skills in practical situations.
Discussion Forums: FreeCodeCamp has an active community where learners can ask questions, discuss problems, and share solutions with fellow learners.
4. Certification
After completing the required lessons and projects for each certification, learners can earn a FreeCodeCamp Certification. These certifications are recognized by many in the tech industry and can serve as proof of a learner's coding skills and knowledge.<br>

The certifications include:

Responsive Web Design
JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
Front End Development Libraries
Data Visualization
APIs and Microservices
Information Security and Quality Assurance
Machine Learning with Python
Note that while FreeCodeCamp's certifications are free and respected by many employers, they are not official degrees. However, the skills and projects gained through the program are highly valued in the job market, and many learners have successfully transitioned into tech careers after completing the curriculum.

5. Community and Support
One of the standout features of FreeCodeCamp is its global community of learners, educators, and professionals. The platform has a large, active forum where learners can ask questions, seek advice, and find solutions to problems they encounter. There are also local FreeCodeCamp meetups and events organized around the world, providing learners with opportunities for networking and collaboration.
