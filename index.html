    For the first time I was not familiar with anything concerning web development.
    But we were introduced to a free web development site by my tutor Mr. Danso.
    The name of the website is freecodecamp. An interactive web design platform which helps students to learn from scatch.
    On the first day it was very hard because I had no idea about html, css and all those stuffs.
    Through this platform i was able to complete several tasks such as a CatPhotoApp, SurveyApp and many more.
    Through that i was able to develop several websites on the platform. This earned me several certificates.
    Some of the certificates includes SurveyApp which i was able to complete on my own through the sites help.
    After building about five certificate Applications, the tutor asked us to host the website we have created.
    With that it was very hard because I was new to everything about hosting. Many students were sharing their work through hosting 
    sites such as tiiny.site, github.com and many more.

        FreeCodeCamp is a nonprofit organization that provides a free, self-paced coding curriculum to help learners develop software development skills.<br> 
        The platform offers interactive coding lessons and coding challenges in areas such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more.<br>

    Certainly! Here's another paragraph about FreeCodeCamp, focusing on its features and community:

    FreeCodeCamp stands out not only for its free curriculum but also for its emphasis on building practical, real-world skills. 
    The platform uses a project-based approach, where students complete coding challenges and build projects that are later showcased in their portfolios. 
    These projects range from simple webpages to full-stack web applications and data visualizations. 
    The community aspect is also a major draw for learners. FreeCodeCamp has a vibrant global community of developers, designers, and learners who contribute to forums, participate in coding events, and collaborate on open-source projects. 
    The community provides valuable peer support, mentorship, and feedback, making the learning journey more engaging and collaborative. Moreover, FreeCodeCampâ€™s certifications are widely recognized by employers, helping learners demonstrate their skills when applying for jobs in the tech industry.
